# Possible Errors and Solutions:
# 1. Error: No module named 'torch'
#    Solution: Make sure you have PyTorch installed. You can install it using pip: `pip install torch`.
#
# 2. Error: KeyError: 'location6'
#    Solution: This error can occur if a robot is assigned a location that is not present in the waste_data dictionary.
#              Ensure that all locations in the city_layout have corresponding entries in the waste_data dictionary.
#              Double-check the city layout and waste data for consistency.
#
# 3. Error: Robot capacity exceeded
#    Solution: This error can happen if the amount of waste at a location exceeds the robot's capacity.
#              Consider increasing the robot's capacity or deploying more robots to handle the waste collection efficiently.
#              Modify the `deploy_robots` method to assign appropriate capacities based on the expected waste amounts.
#
# 4. Error: Inefficient route optimization
#    Solution: If the route optimization is not effective, consider implementing more advanced algorithms.
#              Utilize graph-based algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or the traveling salesman problem (TSP) solver for route optimization.
#              Incorporate real-time traffic data and road network information to calculate optimal routes dynamically.
#              Continuously monitor and adapt the optimization algorithms based on the changing waste collection patterns and system performance.

# Note: The code provided here is a simplified simulation and may not cover all the complexities of real-world waste management.
#       In practice, you would need to integrate with the actual robot control systems, waste sensors, and city infrastructure
#       to deploy the multi-agent system effectively. The simulation can be extended to incorporate more realistic waste generation patterns,
#       collection frequencies, and disposal facility locations based on the specific city's requirements.
#       The waste data, such as the amount of waste at each location, would typically be obtained from smart waste bins equipped with sensors
#       or historical data collected by the city's waste management department.
