# Graph Neural Networks for Material Generation

This repository hosts a project that showcases the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the purpose of generating materials with specific desired properties. The project employs the PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric libraries to construct and train a GNN model using the QM9 dataset.

## Overview

The project is organized into three primary Python files:

- `model.py`: This file outlines the GNN model's architecture utilizing PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric.
- `data_utils.py`: This file includes utility functions for the loading and preprocessing of the QM9 dataset.
- `train.py`: This file contains the implementation for the training loop and evaluation procedures for the GNN model.

## Installation

To execute the project, the following dependencies are required:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- PyTorch
- PyTorch Geometric
- pandas
- scikit-learn

These dependencies can be installed via pip using the command below:

```bash
pip install torch torch-geometric pandas scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The project expects the QM9 dataset file named `qm9_dataset.csv` to be located in the `/content` directory. If your dataset is situated in a different location, you should modify the file path accordingly in the `load_data` function within `data_utils.py`.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShaliniAnandaPhD/PIXEL-PIONEERS-TUTORIALS.git
   ```
2. Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PIXEL-PIONEERS-TUTORIALS/Graph Neural Networks for Material Generation
   ```
3. Execute the `train.py` script to initiate the model's training process:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

This will start the process of loading and preprocessing the QM9 dataset, creating data loaders, defining the GNN model, and commencing the training loop. The console will display updates on the training progress and losses.

Upon completion of training, the model will be saved as `material_gnn_model.pth` in the project directory.

## Project Structure

- `model.py`: Defines the `MaterialGNN` class for the GNN model architecture, incorporating two graph convolutional layers, a global mean pooling layer, and a fully connected layer for predictions.
- `data_utils.py`: Provides the `load_data` function for reading and preprocessing the QM9 dataset, including extraction and preparation of node features and target values.
- `train.py`: Implements the model training and evaluation, including data loading, model setup, loss function, optimizer, and training loop execution. The trained model is saved as `material_gnn_model.pth`.

## Results

The GNN model trained by this project is capable of predicting material properties from their graph representations. Model performance can be assessed using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE) on the test dataset.
