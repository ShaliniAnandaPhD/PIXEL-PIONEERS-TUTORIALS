# Possible Errors and Solutions:
# 1. Error: No module named 'torch'
#    Solution: Make sure you have PyTorch installed. You can install it using pip: `pip install torch`.
#
# 2. Error: Robot capacity exceeded
#    Solution: This error occurs when trying to load more packages onto a robot than its capacity allows.
#              Ensure that the number of packages assigned to each robot does not exceed its capacity.
#              Adjust the package assignment algorithm or increase the robot capacity if necessary.
#
# 3. Error: Package not found on robot
#    Solution: This error happens when trying to deliver a package that is not loaded on the robot.
#              Make sure that the package is correctly assigned to the robot and loaded before attempting delivery.
#              Double-check the package assignment and loading process.
#
# 4. Error: Inefficient package assignment or route optimization
#    Solution: If the package assignment or route optimization is not efficient, consider implementing more advanced algorithms.
#              For package assignment, you can use techniques like bin packing or knapsack algorithms to optimize robot utilization.
#              For route optimization, you can explore algorithms like the traveling salesman problem (TSP) or vehicle routing problem (VRP).
#              Integrate real-world data like traffic conditions and road networks to enhance the optimization process.

# Note: The code provided here is a simplified simulation and may not cover all the complexities of real-world logistics and delivery.
#       In practice, you would need to integrate with the actual robot control systems, package tracking systems, and routing algorithms
#       to deploy the multi-agent system effectively. The simulation can be extended to incorporate more realistic delivery scenarios,
#       dynamic package assignments, and real-time optimization based on changing conditions.
