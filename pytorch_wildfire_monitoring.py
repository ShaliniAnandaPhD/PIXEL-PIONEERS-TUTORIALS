# Possible Errors and Solutions:
# 1. Error: No module named 'torch'
#    Solution: Make sure you have PyTorch installed. You can install it using pip: `pip install torch`.
#
# 2. Error: ValueError: probabilities do not sum to 1
#    Solution: This error can occur if the probabilities provided to np.random.choice() do not sum to 1.
#              Ensure that the probabilities for the 'fire_detected' choice sum up to 1.
#              Adjust the probabilities or normalize them if necessary.
#
# 3. Error: IndexError: list index out of range
#    Solution: This error can happen if the number of robots is not consistent with the grid size.
#              Ensure that the number of robots is equal to or less than the square of the grid size.
#              Modify the `assign_locations` method to handle this case gracefully.
#
# 4. Error: Inaccurate or delayed fire detection
#    Solution: If the fire detection is inaccurate or delayed, consider the following:
#              - Incorporate multiple sensors and data sources to improve the accuracy of fire detection.
#              - Implement advanced algorithms, such as machine learning or computer vision, to analyze the monitoring data.
#              - Establish a robust communication network to ensure timely sharing of information among the robots and the central system.
#              - Integrate with existing wildfire detection systems and databases to validate and confirm the detected fires.

# Note: The code provided here is a simplified simulation and may not cover all the complexities of real-world wildfire monitoring.
#       In practice, you would need to integrate with the actual robot control systems, sensors, and wildfire management software
#       to deploy the multi-agent system effectively. The simulation can be extended to incorporate more realistic fire propagation models,
#       terrain data, and firefighting strategies based on established wildfire management practices.
#       The monitoring data, such as temperature, humidity, and smoke levels, would typically be obtained from sensors installed on the robots
#       or from external data sources like weather stations and satellite imagery.
