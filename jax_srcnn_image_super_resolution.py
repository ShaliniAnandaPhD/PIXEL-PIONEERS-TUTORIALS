# Possible Errors and Solutions:

# ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (x, y) (a, b)
# Solution: Ensure that the shapes of the predictions and targets match exactly when calculating the loss.

# ImportError: No module named 'PIL'
# Solution: Ensure the PIL library is installed using `pip install pillow`.

# RuntimeError: Invalid argument: Non-scalable parameters
# Solution: Ensure all operations in the model are scalable and support JAX's JIT compilation.

# KeyError: 'low_res_image.png'
# Solution: Ensure the file path and name are correct and the image file exists.
