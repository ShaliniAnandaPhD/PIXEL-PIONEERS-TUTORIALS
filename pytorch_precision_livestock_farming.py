# Possible Errors and Solutions:
# 1. Error: No module named 'torch'
#    Solution: Make sure you have PyTorch installed. You can install it using pip: `pip install torch`.
#
# 2. Error: IndexError: list index out of range
#    Solution: This error can occur if the number of animals is not divisible by the number of robots.
#              Ensure that the number of animals is greater than or equal to the number of robots.
#              Modify the `assign_monitoring_tasks` method to handle this case gracefully.
#
# 3. Error: KeyError: 'temperature'
#    Solution: This error can happen if the 'temperature' key is not present in the monitored animal data.
#              Check the `simulate_monitoring` method to ensure that all the required data fields are included.
#              Verify that the data fields in the `detect_anomalies` method match the ones in the simulated data.
#
# 4. Error: Ineffective interventions
#    Solution: If the interventions are not effective in addressing the detected anomalies, consider the following:
#              - Review the threshold values used for detecting anomalies and adjust them based on domain knowledge.
#              - Implement more sophisticated intervention strategies, such as gradual feeding or personalized medication dosing.
#              - Incorporate machine learning techniques to learn from historical data and improve intervention decisions.
#              - Consult with veterinarians or livestock experts to validate and refine the intervention strategies.

# Note: The code provided here is a simplified simulation and may not cover all the complexities of real-world livestock farming.
#       In practice, you would need to integrate with the actual robot control systems, sensors, and farm management software
#       to deploy the multi-agent system effectively. The simulation can be extended to incorporate more realistic animal behavior,
#       environmental factors, and intervention protocols based on established livestock farming practices.
#       The livestock data, such as temperature, heart rate, activity level, and feed intake, would typically be obtained from
#       various sensors and monitoring devices attached to the animals or installed in the farm environment.
