# Possible Errors and Solutions:
# 1. Error: No module named 'torch'
#    Solution: Make sure you have PyTorch installed. You can install it using pip: `pip install torch`.
#
# 2. Error: ValueError: probabilities do not sum to 1
#    Solution: This error can occur if the probabilities provided to np.random.choice() do not sum to 1.
#              Ensure that the probabilities for the 'maintenance_required' choice sum up to 1.
#              Adjust the probabilities or normalize them if necessary.
#
# 3. Error: IndexError: list index out of range
#    Solution: This error can happen if the number of components is not divisible by the number of robots.
#              Ensure that the number of components is greater than or equal to the number of robots.
#              Modify the `assign_tasks` method to handle this case gracefully.
#
# 4. Error: Inefficient maintenance scheduling or coordination
#    Solution: If the maintenance scheduling or coordination is not efficient, consider the following:
#              - Implement a more sophisticated task allocation algorithm to assign tasks based on robot capabilities and component priorities.
#              - Utilize optimization techniques to minimize the total maintenance time and maximize the overall energy production.
#              - Employ machine learning algorithms to predict component failures and schedule preventive maintenance accordingly.
#              - Implement communication protocols for robots to share information and coordinate their actions effectively.

# Note: The code provided here is a simplified simulation and may not cover all the complexities of real-world renewable energy maintenance.
#       In practice, you would need to integrate with the actual robot control systems, sensors, and energy management software
#       to deploy the multi-agent system effectively. The simulation can be extended to incorporate more realistic energy component models,
#       failure scenarios, and maintenance procedures based on industry standards and best practices.
#       The inspection data, such as performance ratio, temperature, and vibration level, would typically be obtained from sensors
#       and monitoring systems installed on the renewable energy components, such as wind turbines or solar panels.
