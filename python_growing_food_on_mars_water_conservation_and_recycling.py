# Python Growing Food on Mars: Creating a System for Water Conservation and Recycling

# Welcome to the seventh class in the "Growing Food on Mars" series!
# In this class, we will learn how to create a Python-based system for water conservation and recycling in a Martian greenhouse.

# First, let's define a class to represent our water storage tank:
class WaterTank:
   def __init__(self, capacity):
       self.capacity = capacity
       self.current_volume = 0

   def add_water(self, volume):
       if self.current_volume + volume <= self.capacity:
           self.current_volume += volume
           print(f"Added {volume} liters of water to the tank.")
       else:
           print("Error: Water tank is full. Cannot add more water.")

   def remove_water(self, volume):
       if volume <= self.current_volume:
           self.current_volume -= volume
           print(f"Removed {volume} liters of water from the tank.")
       else:
           print("Error: Not enough water in the tank.")

   def get_current_volume(self):
       return self.current_volume

# Now, let's create a function to simulate the water usage in the greenhouse:
def simulate_water_usage(tank, usage_rate, days):
   print(f"Simulating water usage for {days} days.")
   for day in range(1, days + 1):
       tank.remove_water(usage_rate)
       print(f"Day {day}: Current water volume is {tank.get_current_volume()} liters.")

# Let's create a function to simulate water recycling:
def simulate_water_recycling(tank, recycling_rate, days):
   print(f"\nSimulating water recycling for {days} days.")
   for day in range(1, days + 1):
       recycled_water = recycling_rate * tank.get_current_volume()
       tank.add_water(recycled_water)
       print(f"Day {day}: Current water volume after recycling is {tank.get_current_volume()} liters.")

# Let's create a water tank with a capacity of 1000 liters:
water_tank = WaterTank(1000)

# Let's add some initial water to the tank:
water_tank.add_water(800)

# Let's simulate water usage for 7 days at a rate of 50 liters per day:
simulate_water_usage(water_tank, 50, 7)

# Now, let's simulate water recycling for 7 days at a rate of 80%:
simulate_water_recycling(water_tank, 0.8, 7)

# Follow along and rewrite this code in your own Python file.
# Feel free to experiment with different tank capacities, usage rates, and recycling rates to see how they affect water conservation.

# In the next class, we will explore how to develop a Python script for monitoring and adjusting nutrient levels in hydroponic systems.
# Get ready to dive deeper into the world of efficient plant growth in Martian greenhouses!
