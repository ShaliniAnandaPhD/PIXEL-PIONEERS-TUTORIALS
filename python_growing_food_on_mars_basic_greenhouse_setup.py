# Python Growing Food on Mars: Setting Up a Basic Martian Greenhouse

# Welcome to the second class in the "Growing Food on Mars" series!
# In this class, we will learn how to set up a basic Martian greenhouse using Python.

# First, let's import the necessary modules:
import math
import random

# Now, let's define some constants for our Martian greenhouse:
GREENHOUSE_LENGTH = 10  # meters
GREENHOUSE_WIDTH = 5    # meters
GREENHOUSE_HEIGHT = 3   # meters

# To calculate the volume of our greenhouse, we can use the following formula:
volume = GREENHOUSE_LENGTH * GREENHOUSE_WIDTH * GREENHOUSE_HEIGHT
print(f"The volume of our Martian greenhouse is {volume} cubic meters.")

# Next, let's create a function to simulate the amount of solar radiation
# reaching the greenhouse on a given day:
def solar_radiation(day):
   # For simplicity, we'll assume a random amount of radiation between 100 and 1000 W/m^2
   return random.randint(100, 1000)

# Now, let's calculate the average solar radiation for a Martian year (687 Earth days):
total_radiation = 0
for day in range(1, 688):
   total_radiation += solar_radiation(day)
average_radiation = total_radiation / 687
print(f"The average solar radiation over a Martian year is {average_radiation:.2f} W/m^2.")

# We can also estimate the amount of heat lost through the greenhouse walls
# using the following simplified formula:
def heat_loss(area, temp_difference, insulation_factor):
   return area * temp_difference * insulation_factor

# Let's calculate the heat loss for our greenhouse, assuming an insulation factor of 0.5:
greenhouse_surface_area = 2 * (GREENHOUSE_LENGTH * GREENHOUSE_WIDTH + 
                              GREENHOUSE_LENGTH * GREENHOUSE_HEIGHT + 
                              GREENHOUSE_WIDTH * GREENHOUSE_HEIGHT)
temp_difference = 50  # degrees Celsius
insulation_factor = 0.5
heat_loss_rate = heat_loss(greenhouse_surface_area, temp_difference, insulation_factor)
print(f"The estimated heat loss rate for the greenhouse is {heat_loss_rate:.2f} W.")

# Follow along and rewrite this code in your own Python file.
# Feel free to experiment with different values for the constants and variables
# to see how they affect the greenhouse setup.

# In the next class, we will explore how to automate temperature control in our Martian greenhouse using Python.
# Get ready to dive deeper into creating a sustainable growing environment on Mars!
