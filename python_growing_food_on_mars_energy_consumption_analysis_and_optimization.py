# Python Growing Food on Mars: Analyzing and Optimizing Energy Consumption in a Martian Greenhouse

# Welcome to the eighteenth class in the "Growing Food on Mars" series!
# In this class, we will learn how to use Python to analyze and optimize energy consumption in a Martian greenhouse.

# Throughout the previous classes, we have explored various Python concepts and tools, such as:
# - Variables and data types
# - Functions and parameters
# - Loops (for and while)
# - Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
# - Lists and dictionaries
# - Classes and objects
# - Modules (random and time)
# - Enumeration (enum)

# In this class, we will introduce a new Python syntax: List Comprehension

# First, let's create a class to represent an energy source:
class EnergySource:
   def __init__(self, name, energy_output):
       self.name = name
       self.energy_output = energy_output

# Let's create a class to represent the greenhouse:
class Greenhouse:
   def __init__(self, energy_sources):
       self.energy_sources = energy_sources
   
   def total_energy_output(self):
       return sum(source.energy_output for source in self.energy_sources)

   def optimize_energy_usage(self, target_output):
       # Using list comprehension to create a new list of optimized energy sources
       optimized_sources = [EnergySource(source.name, source.energy_output * 0.8) for source in self.energy_sources]
       
       optimized_output = sum(source.energy_output for source in optimized_sources)
       
       if optimized_output >= target_output:
           self.energy_sources = optimized_sources
           print("Energy usage optimized.")
       else:
           print("Unable to optimize energy usage while meeting the target output.")

# Let's create some energy sources:
solar_panels = EnergySource("Solar Panels", 5000)
wind_turbines = EnergySource("Wind Turbines", 3000)
nuclear_reactor = EnergySource("Nuclear Reactor", 10000)

energy_sources = [solar_panels, wind_turbines, nuclear_reactor]

# Let's create an instance of the greenhouse:
greenhouse = Greenhouse(energy_sources)

# Let's analyze the total energy output:
total_output = greenhouse.total_energy_output()
print(f"Total energy output: {total_output} kWh")

# Let's set a target energy output:
target_output = 15000

# Let's optimize the energy usage:
greenhouse.optimize_energy_usage(target_output)

# Let's analyze the optimized total energy output:
optimized_total_output = greenhouse.total_energy_output()
print(f"Optimized total energy output: {optimized_total_output} kWh")

# In this class, we introduced the concept of list comprehension, which provides a concise way to create new lists based on existing lists.
# We used list comprehension to create a new list of optimized energy sources in the optimize_energy_usage method.
# List comprehension allows us to transform and filter elements from one list to create a new list in a single line of code.

# Follow along and rewrite this code in your own Python file.
# Feel free to experiment with different energy sources, target outputs, and optimization strategies to further explore energy consumption analysis and optimization in a Martian greenhouse.

# In the next class, we will explore how to develop a Python script for predicting and mitigating the effects of Martian dust storms on greenhouse operations.
# Get ready to dive deeper into the world of resilient agriculture on Mars!
