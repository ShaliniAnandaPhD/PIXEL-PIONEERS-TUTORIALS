# Python Growing Food on Mars: Simulating Martian Soil Composition and Its Effects on Plant Growth

# Welcome to the sixth class in the "Growing Food on Mars" series!
# In this class, we will learn how to simulate Martian soil composition and its effects on plant growth using Python.

# First, let's define a dictionary representing the composition of Martian soil:
martian_soil = {
   "iron_oxide": 0.15,
   "silicon_dioxide": 0.45,
   "aluminum_oxide": 0.10,
   "calcium_oxide": 0.08,
   "magnesium_oxide": 0.07,
   "sodium_oxide": 0.05,
   "potassium_oxide": 0.04,
   "titanium_dioxide": 0.01,
   "other": 0.05
}

# Let's define a function to calculate the soil's nutrient content based on its composition:
def calculate_nutrient_content(soil_composition):
   # For simplicity, we'll assume that the nutrient content is the sum of the percentages of calcium, magnesium, and potassium oxides
   return soil_composition["calcium_oxide"] + soil_composition["magnesium_oxide"] + soil_composition["potassium_oxide"]

# Now, let's create a function to simulate plant growth based on the nutrient content of the soil:
def simulate_plant_growth(nutrient_content):
   # We'll assume that the plant growth rate is directly proportional to the nutrient content
   growth_rate = nutrient_content * 10
   print(f"The plant growth rate in this Martian soil is {growth_rate:.2f}%.")

# Let's calculate the nutrient content of our Martian soil and simulate plant growth:
nutrient_content = calculate_nutrient_content(martian_soil)
print(f"The nutrient content of the Martian soil is {nutrient_content:.2f}.")
simulate_plant_growth(nutrient_content)

# Now, let's see how we can modify the soil composition to improve plant growth:
# We'll add some organic matter (represented by carbon) to the soil
martian_soil["carbon"] = 0.03

# Let's recalculate the nutrient content and simulate plant growth with the modified soil:
modified_nutrient_content = calculate_nutrient_content(martian_soil)
print(f"\nAfter adding organic matter, the nutrient content of the Martian soil is {modified_nutrient_content:.2f}.")
simulate_plant_growth(modified_nutrient_content)

# Follow along and rewrite this code in your own Python file.
# Feel free to experiment with different soil compositions and see how they affect plant growth.

# In the next class, we will explore how to create a Python-based system for water conservation and recycling in a Martian greenhouse.
# Get ready to dive deeper into the challenges of managing water resources on the Red Planet!
