# Possible Errors and Solutions:
# 1. Error: No module named 'torch'
#    Solution: Make sure you have PyTorch installed. You can install it using pip: `pip install torch`.
#
# 2. Error: ValueError: probabilities do not sum to 1
#    Solution: This error can occur if the probabilities provided to np.random.choice() do not sum to 1.
#              Ensure that the probabilities for each choice (e.g., 'soil_composition', 'artifact_presence') sum up to 1.
#              Adjust the probabilities or normalize them if necessary.
#
# 3. Error: KeyError: 'artifact_type'
#    Solution: This error can happen if the 'artifact_type' key is not present in the simulated exploration data.
#              Check the `simulate_exploration` method to ensure that all the required data fields are included.
#              Verify that the data fields in the `share_findings` and `analyze_findings` methods match the ones in the simulated data.
#
# 4. Error: Inefficient exploration or decision-making
#    Solution: If the exploration or decision-making process is not efficient, consider the following:
#              - Implement more sophisticated exploration strategies, such as dividing the site into grids or using priority-based exploration.
#              - Utilize machine learning techniques to learn patterns and make informed decisions based on historical data.
#              - Incorporate domain knowledge from archaeologists to guide the exploration process and prioritize promising areas.
#              - Employ collaboration and communication mechanisms to share findings and coordinate actions among the robots.

# Note: The code provided here is a simplified simulation and may not cover all the complexities of real-world archaeological exploration.
#       In practice, you would need to integrate with the actual robot control systems, sensors, and data analysis tools
#       to deploy the multi-agent system effectively. The simulation can be extended to incorporate more realistic terrain features,
#       artifact distribution, and exploration techniques based on archaeological best practices.
#       The archaeological data, such as soil composition and artifact presence, would typically be obtained from various sensors
#       and analysis techniques used in the field, such as ground-penetrating radar, magnetometers, and visual inspection.
