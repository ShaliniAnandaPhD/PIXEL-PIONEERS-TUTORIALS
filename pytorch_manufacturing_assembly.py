# Possible Errors and Solutions:
# 1. Error: No module named 'torch'
#    Solution: Make sure you have PyTorch installed. You can install it using pip: `pip install torch`.
#
# 2. Error: IndexError: index 3 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 3
#    Solution: This error can occur if the number of dimensions in the `part_locations` array does not match the expected size.
#              Make sure that the size of `part_locations` is consistent with the number of parts and dimensions.
#              Adjust the size of `part_locations` in the `generate_assembly_info` method accordingly.
#
# 3. Error: KeyError: 'capability'
#    Solution: This error can happen if the 'capability' key is not present in the assembly task dictionary.
#              Ensure that each task in the `assembly_tasks` list has a 'capability' key specifying the required capability.
#              Double-check the task definitions and make sure they include the 'capability' key.
#
# 4. Error: No capable robot found for a task
#    Solution: This error occurs when there is no robot with the required capability to perform a specific assembly task.
#              Consider increasing the number of robots or assigning additional capabilities to the existing robots.
#              Modify the `deploy_robots` method to assign capabilities based on the specific requirements of the assembly tasks.

# Note: The code provided here is a simplified simulation and may not cover all the complexities of real-world manufacturing assembly.
#       In practice, you would need to integrate with the actual robot control systems, sensor data, and manufacturing execution systems (MES)
#       to deploy the multi-agent system effectively. The simulation can be extended to incorporate more realistic assembly scenarios,
#       task dependencies, resource constraints, and optimization algorithms based on real-time data from the manufacturing process.
#       Assembly information, such as part locations and orientations, would typically be obtained from computer-aided design (CAD) models,
#       vision systems, or other sensing mechanisms in a real-world setting.
